                        I am Pierre, I currently work at Novartis in the cancer department as an associate scientist. Previously, I took a Java course and now I would like to take a shot at Web Development. I have a few friends in the industry and from the stories they shared with me, it seems very interesting and I hope this course is a step in the right direction.
